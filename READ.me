I didnt really encounter challenges while doing this project(I follwed a youtube video), but here are things to note :
* I can't -text align an anchor tag <a>- because it is an inline element, so i had to display:flex for the anchor tag in the footer section
* I didn't use html semantics{I will work on the semantics later on}
* It was essential that I present my project, and it is possible that you encounter minor errors therin{I am a learner who is opened to suggestions and learning}
* You can click on the github and twitter text -that is right below the copyright text- to access my socials
             Yours sincerely Oluwanifemi Orimoloye
